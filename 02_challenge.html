        <p>
        Nobody’s born <em>smart.</em> We all start at <em>0.</em> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at <strong>anything<em> at first.</em></strong><br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to <strong><em>learn his ABCs</em></strong>  just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to <em>learn.</em></strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each <em>wrong answer</em> making your brain a little bit <em>stronger.</em> </strong><br>
        Failing is just another word for <em>growing.</em> And you keep <em>going.</em><br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, <em>anywhere</em> can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
        <strong>You can  <em>learn anything.</em> </strong>
