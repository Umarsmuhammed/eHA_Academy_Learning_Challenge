    <h1>The Power of Poetry</h1>
    <p>- What is a nice poem but a wordy present<br>
        - That can bring joy or tears to the eyes<br>
        - It can convey an emotion or an idea<br>
        - Or freeze a moment in time<br>
        - A nice poem is a masterpiece<br>
        - That can move a soul or a brain<br>
        - It can motivate, soothe or please<br>
        - Or simply be humane</p>
